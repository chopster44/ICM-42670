# ICM-42670
A driver for the TDK InvenSense ICM-42670 6-axis motion sensor. 

This library is made to work with the Odyssey Flight Computer (Coming Soon!). 

## Dependencies

I have built this based of the Adafruit Unified Sensor Library because it has some nice helper functions and all the other sensors in my firmware are using it.

Also includes Adafruit Bus IO for the same reasons.

## Instalation

To install add:
`https://github.com/chopster44/ICM-42670.git` to your `platformio.ini` file.
